In fact, the Torah says that " <a href = "null">Any sin-offering whose blood was brought into the Tent of Meeting... may not be eaten</a> ." Rabbi Eliezer says that this is also true of the guilt-offering, since the Torah said, "just as the guilt-offering so is the sin-offering," but the Sages insist that this is only true for the sin-offering. <br/> <br/> What is the reason of the Sages - for seemingly, the Torah supports Rabbi Eliezer? The Sages defend with this logic: if burnt offering, which is completely burnt, is not disqualified by bringing its blood inside the Temple, then the guilt-offering, which is not completely burnt, surely cannot be thus disqualified! Now the arguments are as follows: <br/> <br/> * burnt offering is no proof, because it does not achieve atonement! <br/> * but the flour of a the one who swore falsely achieves atonement and still it is not disqualified if part of it is brought inside! <br/> * but the flour does not require slaughter! <br/> * but burnt offering does require slaughter and is not disqualified! <br/> <br/> We came a full circle. What is common between all these? That they are holy and are not disqualified by bringing their blood inside, so the guilt-offering is not disqualified - say the Sages. <br/> <br/> Art: Abraham Solomon - Not Guilty (The Acquittal) <br/></body></html>
