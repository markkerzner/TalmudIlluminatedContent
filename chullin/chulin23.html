Rabbi Zeira asked, "Is this for sure or out of doubt?" Meaning, if one promised a bird burnt offering and then brought a turtledove and a pigeon with yellowing feathers, is at least one of them valid, or, because it is a bird in a class by itself, neither is valid? <br/> <br/> Try this answer: the Torah said "sacrifices â€¦ from birds," and this means that some birds are excluded. Which ones? Isn't it ones with yellowing feathers? - No! Excluded are <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/zevachim/zevachim85.html">birds that were sodomized</a> or worshiped, and Rabbi Zeira does not get an answer. <br/> <br/> He asked a similar question about sheep. A sheep younger than twelve months is a lamb, one older than thirteen is a ram, what is its status in between? Does it require libations like either a lamb or a ram, or is it a separate creature with no libations? Again, no answer. He also asked about dough in intermediate stages of leavening, can it be brought as part of a thanksgiving offering. <br/> <br/> Art: Antonio Paoletti - Feeding The Pigeons At Piazza St. Marco, Venice <br/></body></html>
