(1) the portion of their father, Tzelophchad, who was among those who left Egypt; (2) their father's portion among  brothers in the estate of Chepher, his father; (3) an extra share in the estate of Chepher, to which their father was entitled because he was a firstborn. <br/> <br/> Number (1) teaches that the Land of Israel was divided among those who left Egypt, even if they were not living at the time of the conquest of Israel; Number (2) teaches that the daughter of a son received a share even when her father's brothers are alive; Number (3) teaches that the Land of Israel is considered to have been in possession of those who left Egypt. <br/> <br/> Art: Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida - My wife and my daughters in the garden <br/></body></html>
