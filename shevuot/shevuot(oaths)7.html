When he finally does find out about his past impurity, he then brings a "variable sacrifice." <br/> <br/> But maybe the goat of Yom Kippur atones even for idol worship, prohibited relations, and bloodshed, because these are also characterized as "impure"? - No! Yom Kippur atones only "from impurities of the Children of Israel," but not all impurities - these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Shimon derives the same answer from the context of Yom Kippur - it atones only for matters related to the Temple service. <br/> <br/> Art: Theodore Robinson - Girl with a goat <br/></body></html>
