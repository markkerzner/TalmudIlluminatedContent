The High Court marches around the perimeter of the area being added, and the two loaves of the Thanksgiving offering in front of them - carried by the kohanim - and all Israel behind them. The Thanksgiving loaves were used because they can only be eaten inside of Jerusalem, and they were very large, made with a few hundred cups of flour. They sang " <a href = "null">The Song of Thanksgiving, call out to God everyone on earth.</a> ", accompanied by harps, lyres, and cymbals. <br/> <br/> Art: Jan De Bray - David Playing the Harp <br/></body></html>
