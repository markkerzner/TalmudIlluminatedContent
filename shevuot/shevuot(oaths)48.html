Before collecting, they must take an "oath of heirs," which states that to the best of their knowledge the debt was not repaid. <br/> <br/> However, as both Rav and Shmuel have stated, that is only true if the lender died first. If, on the other hand, the borrower died first, then the lender has to take a definite oath that the debt was not repaid. His children cannot take such a definite oath, but only to the best of their knowledge, and it is not sufficient. Thus, if their father now dies, they cannot collect the money at all. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Elazar in Israel disagreed, "Just because the lender's children cannot take the same oath as him, must they forfeit their father's debt?" <br/> <br/> In practice, the ruling of Rav and Shmuel was followed, but, since there was not a definite decision either way, if a judge ruled in accordance with Rabbi Elazar, his ruling would also stand. <br/> <br/> Art: Luigi Nono - A Child's Funeral</body></html>
