Didn't we <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/shevuot-oaths/shevuot-oaths44.html">require the worker to swear about his wage in a similar case</a> ? The answer is that in this other case, the employer may have forgotten which worker he already paid. However, in the case of wage dispute, the employer certainly remembers the amount of stipulation. <br/> <br/> Art: Jean-Francois Millet - Forest workers in the wood saws</body></html>
