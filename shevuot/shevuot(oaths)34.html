This establishes the connection between the two, and just as oath of deposits speaks only of a monetary claims, so too the oath of testimony speaks only of a monetary claim. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Akiva: <br/> <br/> In the phrase, " <a href = "null">When one shall become guilty in regard to one of these matters</a> ," the word "of" is a limitation, meaning that there are cases when one is liable and cases when one is not, and when is he liable? - in money matters! <br/> <br/> Rabbi Yose HaGlili: <br/> <br/> "... <a href = "null">and he is a witness who either saw or knew</a> ." Which testimony can be established by either seeing or knowing alone? - in money matters! <br/> <br/> Art: Thomas Hickey - John Mowbray with his money agent</body></html>
