This oath can be imposed only if the claim is at least for two silver maot (volume of 32 grains of barley, about $10), and the admission is at least a perutah coin (half a silver barleycorn, under 25 cents). <br/> <br/> In addition, partial admission must be for the same kind. For example, if the plaintiff says, "You have two silver coins in my possession," and the defendant responds, "You have only one perutah coin in my possession," the defendant is free from an oath, because the claim was for silver, and the admission - for copper. <br/> <br/> Art: Thomas Waterman Wood - The Doubtful Coin <br/></body></html>
