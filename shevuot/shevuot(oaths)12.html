However, Rabbi Shimon disagrees with this. In looking for the opponents of Rabbi Shimon, whose view Rabbi Yochanan follows, we fail to find an explicit recorded ruling and are forced to conclude that Rabbi Yochanan had a tradition from his teachers to this effect. <br/> <br/> But according to Rabbi Shimon, what do we do with the leftover lambs? - We offer them as treats on the Altar. This agrees with Rabbi Shimon's view that offerings of a similar nature (in this case, they are burnt-offerings, totally consumed on the Altar) are interchangeable. <br/> <br/> Art: James Ward - Heath Ewe and Lamb <br/></body></html>
