<h2>Suggested ways of using the site</h2>
<li>Your students can read the appropriate page and familiarize themselves with the matter. Then they can grasp your lesson easier.</li>
<li>If you find a problem with the text, you can leave a comment. If the comment is convincing, it will be incorporated in the page.</li>

<h2>Principles of the commentary</h2>
<li>Safe. When writing, I was thinking of representatives of any nation or religion reading it.</li>
<li>Complete. For example, I have all cases of Y A L K G M. Like <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">this.</a>
<li>A story. Not just shorthand notes, but a complete story every time.</li>
<li>English, not yeshivish.</li>
