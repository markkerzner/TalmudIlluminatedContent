man may not be secluded even with two women (and certainly not with
one), because a woman may hope that her female companion can be
convinced to duplicate her act &#8211; following the teaching that the minds
of women are easily swayed.<br><br>One may be secluded with two women if his wife is present, and he may even sleep in the same room as them in an inn.<br><br>A

but if they aren't, then even with a group of ten it is not permitted.
