Rabbi Meir says, four issars per sela , or 1/24. Rabbi Yehuda says, 1/12, and Rabbi Shimon says eight pundions , or 1/6. For how long can one return a defective coin? In large cities, as long as it takes to show the coin to a moneychanger; in villages, until the following Sabbath, when the person will use it shopping for food. <br/> Coins that still circulate, albeit with difficulty, should be accepted, and the one who doesn’t is called stingy. After this they should be used for necklaces or destroyed. <br/> <br/></body></html>
