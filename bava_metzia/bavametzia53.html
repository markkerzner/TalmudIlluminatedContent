If it is too far to bring it to Jerusalem, or if the Temple is not standing, it should be redeemed for money. <br/> If one wishes to redeem a small amount of second tithe, such as one grape, which is worth less than a prutah , he can’t do it for such small amount alone, but should add its sanctity to the money used for previous redemptions of larger amounts. <br/> In a special case a small amount that was brought to Jerusalem - and then the walls of Jerusalem fell - cannot be redeemed. <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
